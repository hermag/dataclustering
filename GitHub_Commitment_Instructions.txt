#General comment - GitHub doesn't accept the empty folders it should contain at least one empty file.
1. to add the folder or file to the repository - git add test
2. to commit the changes to the head server - git commit -m "blabla"
3. to apply the changes to the master branch - git push origin master
4. to delete the file or folder from the GitHub repository - git rm -rf filename/foldername (the rest procedures are the same)
